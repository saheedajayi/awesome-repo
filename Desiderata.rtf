\par
Go placidly amind the noise and haste,\par
and remember what peace there may be in silence.\par
As far as possible without surrender\par
be on good terms with all persons.\par
Speak your truth quietly and clearly;\par
and listen to others,\par
even the dull and the ignorant;\par
they too have their story.\par
\par
\par
Avoid loud and aggressive persons,\par
they are vexations to the spirit.\par
If you compare yoursef with others;\par
you may become vain and bitter;\par
for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.\par
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.\par
\par
Keep interested in your own career, however humble;\par
it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.\par
Exercise caution in your business affairs;\par
for the world is full of trickery.\par
But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;\par
many persons strive for high ideals;\par
and everywhere life is full of heroism.\par
\par
Be yourself.\par
Especially, do not feign affection.\par
Neither be cynical about love;\par
for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment\par
it is as perennial as the grass.\par
\par
Take kindly the counsel of the years,\par
gracefully surrendering the things of youth.\par
Nuture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.\par
But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.\par
Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.\par
Beyond  a wholesome discipline,\par
be gentle with yourself.\par
\par
You are a child of the universe,\par
no less than the trees and the stars;\par
you have a right to be here.\par
And whether or not it is clear to you,\par
no doubt the unvierse is unfolding as it should.\par
\par
Thererfore be at peace with God,\par
whatever you conceive Him to be,\par
and whatever your labors and aspirations,\par
in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.\par
\par
With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,\par
it is still a beautiful world.\par
Be cheerful.\par
Strive to be happy.\par

\b EQUIPMENT\par
\b0\par
Figure it out for yourself, my lad,\par
You've all that the greatest of men have had,\par
Two arms, two hands, two legs, two eyes\par
And a brain to use if you would be wise.\par
With this equipment they all began,\par
So start for the top and say, "I can."\par
\par
Look them over, the wise and great\par
They take their food from a common plate,\par
And similar knives and forks they use,\par
With similar laces they tie their shoes.\par
The world considers them brave and smart,\par
But you've all they had when they made their start.\par
\par
You can triumph and come to skill,\par
You can be great if you only will.\par
You're well equipped for what fight you choose,\par
You have legs and arms and a brain to use,\par
And the man who has risen great deeds to do\par
Began his life with no more than you.\par
\par
You are the handicap you must face,\par
You are the one who must choose your place,\par
You must say where you want to go,\par
How much you will study the truth to know.\par
God has equipped you for life, but He\par
Lets you decide what you want to be.\par
\par
Courage must come from the soul within,\par
The man must furnish the will to win.\par
So figure it out for yourself, my lad.\par
You were born with all that the great have had,\par
With your equipment they all began,\par
Get hold of yourself and say: "I can."\par
